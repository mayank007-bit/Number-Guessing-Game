# Number-Guessing-Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game project! This is a simple console-based game created using Java. The goal of the game is to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct, and keeps track of the number of attempts made.
